Tetris Co-Op
============


Made by Minh Le and Ibukun Adeleye for 15-440 S14 Project 3 

##Description

Tetris Co-op is a Tetris-based game that can be played cooperatively between two to four players. Each player is given a distinct stream of Tetris blocks,which float down from the top of the board. The players can each move their distinct piece anywhere down the board, at varying speeds. The goal is for the players to cooperative clear lines with the pieces given and prevent the Tetris blocks from reaching the top of the board. 

##Implementation

The implementation has three major components: the game clients, the game servers, and the storage servers. The game client and associated GUI will be implemented in Javascript. The game client will communicate with the game server via HTTP requests. The game servers and the storage servers will be written in Go, and communicate with each other via Go RPC. 

One storage server will store all the game state and associated data, but it will be replicated for fault tolerance using a 5-member Multi-PAXOS. A centralized data server will handle the membership for multi-PAXOS. If we have time, we will synchronize global shared resources with Lamportâ€™s Distributed Mutual Exclusion.


##Usage

All servers should be started on the GHC linux cluster at unix5.andrew.cmu.edu since this is the address that the clients will connect to. The following commands assume that you have executed the commands 'go install crunner' ; 'go install grunner' ; ' go install main/tests/ptest' ; 'go build replicaserver' ; 'go install main/runner/' . 
To start a central server: 

$GOPATH/bin/crunner -port 8085 -numGS 1 -numNodes 3 

To start a game server: 

$GOPATH/bin/grunner -game_port 8060 -central_port 8085 -id 1

*you must initially start up central server and then you can start up replicas

$GOPATH/bin/runner -N=3 -master="localhost:8085" -port=1234 -f=0
